Requirements for Replicating the Car Configuration Page in React
Component Structure

The application should be divided into modular and reusable components.
Key components include:
Main container
Navigation bar
Car selection component
Form component
Individual components for each step
State Management

Implement state to manage:
The selected car model
The selected car version
The current step in the process
Any form data entered by the user
User Interaction & Reactivity

The page should dynamically update based on user interactions.
Implement features such as:
Updating navigation
Switching between steps
Processing form inputs
Conditional Rendering

Components and elements should be displayed based on the application's state.
Example: If a user selects a car model, only then should the corresponding version options be shown.
Form Handling

Validate user inputs as needed.
Capture and process form data when the user submits it.
Would you like me to refine or expand on any specific part?
